NonStop Explorer Lite
---

This is a lightweight version of the NonStop Explorer client app which uses only HTML and Javascript.
The client shows the requests and responses that are sent and received from LightWave Server. These
are the same requests/responses used by the AngularJS version of the app.

The sample does not require a web server. Simply open the index.html file using any modern
browser.
